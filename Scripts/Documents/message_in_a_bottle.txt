To Who'ever,
As I scrach these marks onto this papper, the seas gone plumb mad, like a rabid beast it be. 
This ocean, once me haven, now be a place of wild calamity and dread.
Am surrounded by shipmates with origins as murky as the briney deep. 
Whispurs of curses and apparitions a constant shadow, while a force beyond our reckonin drives us into the dark unknowen.
Each night, under them stars, we swap tales in hushed tones, our voices quivern like leaves in a gale. 
Enclos'd is the only trinket I wanted to save on this here perelous voyage. 
I can't rightly expound on its significance, for such talk might beck'n horrors I'd rather keep dormint.
Should ye chance upon this here missive, consider yerself the keeper of a burden of weighty measure. 
Whether ye embrase it or lettin it fade into the obscurety of the briny deep be yer choice.
May the winds be kind, and may the stormy seas unveil their mysterys to ye, as they've done to us.
With a heavy heart and wary eyes,
Edy
