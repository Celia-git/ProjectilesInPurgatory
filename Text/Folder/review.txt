Over the course of my coastal travels, I visited the Great Spectacle of which we've
all heard so much.  Past the pigs and pony races, beyond the Big Tent, Underneath a 
hastily erected canvas, the Medicine Man, a master of the enigmatic and the artful 
dodge, began his performance with a theatrical flourish.  With impeccable showmanship, he 
spun yarns of fantastical elixirs possessing the ability to mend the most grievous of maladies, 
he so expounded upon the arcane ingredients and mystical techniques.
The most curious interlude of the evening featured willing participants who enthusiastically 
volunteered for the Medicine Man's experimental treatments. They partook in activities, sang 
songs, and offered testimonials of miraculous transformations, swayed by true belief.
